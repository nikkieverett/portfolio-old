            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a Texan born and raised, and a graduate of The Iron Yard's Front-End Engineering course. Learning is, and always will be my passion, and that's why I chose a career in development.
              <br />
              <br />
              I am most motivated by my need for creativity. I want to make things that are not only beautiful but also useful. Whether that's through photography, carpentry, sculpture, gardening, or web development, I find my drive when there's a problem that needs to be solved.

              <p><strong>Not Yo Mama's Recipes</strong> is a personal recipe storage app. I built it for my mom to store her recipes in; partly for selfish reasons (i.e. so that I could have access to them) and partly for non-selfish reasons (i.e. so that other people could have access to them). I built this app from scratch including front-end, back-end, database, user-interface, and also handled deployment.</p>
